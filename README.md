## How does it work
To start publishing your podcast you simply need a two things: Public accessible storage for your audio files, and RSS feed providing information necessary information about podcast and episodes in valid XML format. Only if we would have a cloud-based services providing terrabytes of storage for ridiculously low price and service for providing a Http-based serverless API with milions of monthly invocations for free... Oh wait! We have Azure Storage Account & Azure Functions! Yes, this solution does exactly that - checking your blobs (audio files) on Storage Account and providing valid RSS XML over Azure Functions.

## Requirements

To use this solution you need to have an access to Azure Portal and be logged in. If you don't have an accout, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

## Pre-installation

You need to have binaries ready for deploy. You can easily [download the latest ZIP version](https://github.com/Dzoukr/Funcaster/releases) from Releases, or you can build your own by checkout this repository and running:

```cli
> dotnet tool restore
> dotnet run publish
```

Custom build output as well as ZIP file can be found in `publish` folder on the root level of the solution. No matter which one you'll choose, get your ZIP file ready for deployment described in the next chapter.


## Installation

We will need to install and setup two things: Storage Account for your podcasts, and Azure Functions app for management around those files. It's pretty easy so just follow the steps and you are quickly done.

### Storage Account

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create new Storage Account service

Once logged in Azure Portal, create a new Storage Account a wait for deployment is complete.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create root container

All your podcast data need to be stored somewhere. This is why we create a new blob container called `podcast` with _Blob permissions (anonymous read access for blobs only)._ This means that data in this folder can be accessed publicly (we need that).

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Copy access key

To connect serverless part of ‚ö°Funcaster with newly created Storage Account, you need to copy a connection string.

Cool! Now everything is ready for the second part - Azure Functions.

### Azure Functions

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create new Function App

Create new Function app with any name you would like to use, select the same region your Storage Account is in, choose `.NET6` and proceed to creation. If you would like to have a built-in monitoring, turn on the Application Insights.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup connection string, runtime, and version

At this date (17. 10. 2021), ‚ö°Funcaster is built on `.NET5` using `dotnet-isolated` as worker runtime, which is equivalent to `~3` extension version. We need to set this properly in configuration + add connection string to prepared Storage Account.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy ‚ö°Funcaster

Ok, let's deploy our ZIP file! There are many ways (CI solutions like GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipelines are preferred), but let's take the shortcut here and use the KUDU ZIP deployment running at `https://<NAME_OF_YOUR_FUNCTION_APP>.scm.azurewebsites.net/`

Great! Your solution is _almost_ ready! Now it's time to add some podcast content, can we?

## Using ‚ö°Funcaster

Your podcasting solution is ready for serving files stored on blob storage. Let's start using it!![](docs/data_01.gif)

### Uploading new episodes

To add new episodes, you just simply upload files into `episodes` (virtual) container in your `podcast` container:

### Publishing episodes

After few seconds, ‚ö°Funcaster will find the newly uploaded file and create a basic metadata `yaml` file named same as the original file. You can switch to different view to see what's inside.

![](docs/data_02.gif)

You can see that ‚ö°Funcaster sniffed the newly uploaded file and already prefilled basic information like `url`, `type` or `length` for you. You need to give it some proper title (we don't wanna call our episodes as empty string), description and the duration of the episode in `HH:MM:SS` format. After updating those, just click on Save button.

![](docs/data_03.gif)

Great! We are nearly done! The last step is to setup our podcast metadata. That's why we have automatically created `podcast.yaml` file on the root level. Let's fill it, can we?

![](docs/data_04.gif)

IT'S DONE! ü•≥üéÜüéä Let's see how our RSS feed looks like. Navigate to https://<NAME_OF_YOUR_FUNCTION_APP>.azurewebsites.net/rss and behold!

### Using RSS feed

Now it's up to you where you wanna publish your podcast. I've already succesfully published to [Spotify Podcasts](https://open.spotify.com/show/280aceAx85AKZslVytXsrB), [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/podvocasem/id1590431276) and [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkLnBvZHZvY2FzZW0uY3ovcnNz) but I'am pretty sure it will work for other providers too.

## FAQ

### Should I use this instead of Soundcloud?

It's up to you. Soundcloud offers great social features like likes, built-in web player and many more, but it costs over 8 EUR / months. If you just need to publish your podcast for (almost) zero costs, ‚ö°Funcaster is here at your service.

### What if I need embedded player on my site?

Spotify and Apple offer an easy way of creating embedded players directly from the application or [marketing tools](https://tools.applemediaservices.com/). Or just use `<audio>` HTML5 tag.

### What's the `_index.yaml` file for?

This file is automatically created and updated by ‚ö°Funcaster to be aware of all the episodes you have without going through whole blob storage file system tree and scanning. You shouldn't care about this file until you need to...

### What if I need to delete an episode?

Thanks to fact that `BlobTrigger` is not fired when something is removed, you need to do some manual work. First step is to remove `YourFileToBeDeleted.mp3` and `YourFileToBeDeleted.yaml`. Second step is to go into `_index.yaml` and delete it from index.

### Can I have an episodes stored in deeper structure?

Sure! The only required thing is to have them stored in `episodes` folder - this is where ‚ö°Funcaster is sniffing around. But if you upload your file directly in this folder or you create `episodes\some\completely\weird\logic\for\storing\my\files` it's your call.
